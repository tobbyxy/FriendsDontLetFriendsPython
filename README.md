# FriendsDontLetFriendsPython
Friends don't let friends make certain types of data visualization - What are they and why are they bad.

This project is motivated by the popular data visualization do's and don't. I decided to create my own version in python, for two reasons. First, it allows me practice my python skills and two allows me reiterate the data visualization problems that can occur when good practices are not adhered to.
